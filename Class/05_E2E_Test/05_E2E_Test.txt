*) E2E Test:
    -> for this we need the another package:
    -> npm install --save-dev puppeteer
    -> now inside package.json:
        -> "scripts": {
                "test-w": "jest --watch --detectOpenHandles"
            },
    -> this is a headless version of chrome browser, so it is basically a browser we can use interact with dom
    -> and we define steps that should be executed in that browser so that we can automate certain processes on our web page and then of course test a result of these processes as well
