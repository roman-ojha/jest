*) Testing Setup:
    -> for writing test we need some external tools
    -> So we need 3 kind of tools:
        1) Test Runner (Unit + Integration)
            -> Execute you tests, summarize results
                -> E.g: Mocha
        2) Assertion Library (Unit + Integration)
            -> Define testing logic, conditions
            -> E.g : Chai
            -> But we will use for 'Test Runner' and 'Assertion Library' is 'Jest'
        3) Headless Browser (e2e)
            -> Simulates browser interaction
            -> E.g: puppeteer

*) Installing Jest:
    -> https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started
    -> https://github.com/facebook/jest
    -> npm install --save-dev jest
    -> now inside package.json:
        -> "scripts": {
                "test": "jest"
            },
